# What is this

It has sence to start a new project from time to time
just to refresh your skills. It is the project of this type.

Practically, it is a words trainer, but the main goal -
is to use 'modern practices' unaviable in real lont-term
projects, that had started long before some modern
tooling were created.

# Features

We need a words trainer that can hold a set of collections
of word(phrase) - translation pairs. It should be possible
to manage the collections and select them to be used for
the quize mode. In the quiz mode words from selected collections should be shown randomly with some variants of translations. And reversly. It should calculate statistic.
It should load collections from shared Google Sheets.
It should be possible to save collections locally
to avoid nesesserity to reload them every seanse.

I want to load words from Google Sheets 'cos it's simple
to manage and share words in such way.

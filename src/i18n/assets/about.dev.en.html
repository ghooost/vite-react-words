<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>
  The foreign words trainer itself is useful but nothing special. Although I
  made it for myself to learn Finnish. However, the main benefit is to create a
  simple showcase application in React/Redux/TypeScript, configure the
  environment, linters, tests, and a simple CI for GitHub Pages.
</p>
<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>
  React, Redux, TypeScript, ReactRouter, Vite, Vitest, Scorebook, light/dark
  themes support. Google Sheet API, Flickr API.
</p>
<h2>Mobile and desktop interfaces</h2>
<p>
  I deliberately refused to use media queries in favor of subscribing to changes
  in window sizes and the useIsMobile hook. You can see the code in
  src/components/IsMobile.

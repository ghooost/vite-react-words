<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>
  This is a foreign words trainer. In the Quiz mode, a word (or a picture) and
  several translation options are shown. If you answer correctly, the next word
  (or phrase) is displayed and so on.{" "}
</p>
<h2>Word collections</h2>
<p>
  You can manage word collections in the Setup. Each collection has a name (just
  a name, it's only needed to find the collection in the list) and an URL of
  Google Sheet or Flickr Album.
</p>
<h2>Google Sheet</h2>
<p>
  Words and translations are initially stored in Google Sheets documents and
  imported from there when needed. Thus, to add a word collection, you need to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a Google Sheets document</li>
  <li>
    Fill it with words (cells in column A) and translations (cells in column B)
  </li>
  <li>Allow anyone to view the document</li>
  <li>Copy and paste URL to the collection properties</li>
  <li>Mark the collection with a star</li>
</ul>
<h2>Flickr albums</h2>
<p>
  Instead of using Google Sheets, you can use a Flickr album with pictures. In
  this case, during the Quiz mode, an image will be shown, and answer options
  will be generated from the titles of the pictures. So,
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upload pictures to Flickr</li>
  <li>
    Collect them in an album make sure the album is set to be viewable by
    everyone
  </li>
  <li>
    Copy the album link from your browser's address bar. Note that the link
    should look something like this:
    https://www.flickr.com/photos/xxxx/albums/yyyy Flickr can shorten links, and
    in the Share window, it offers shortened links. However, we need the full
    links because we can use them to obtain your User Id and the album Id.
  </li>
  <li>Paste the URL into the collection properties</li>
  <li>Mark the collection with a star</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example Google Sheets</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
